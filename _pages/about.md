## Our Mission

At Tastebud Studio, our mission is to create delightful culinary experiences that bring people together and celebrate the art of food. These include hosting tasting & pairing workshops, sharing recipes, and fostering a community of food enthusiasts.

## Our Story

In 2008, Joel began homebrewing and discovered a passion for flavor training. As a Beer Judge Certification Program (BJCP) certified judge, he honed his skills in evaluating and appreciating flavors. This journey led him to judge in many homebrew beer & mead competitions along with judging spirit competitions for the Wisconsin State Fair. He appreciates other forms of culinary training & pairing often involving coffee, chocolate, and cheese.

He enjoys writing about his adventures and traveling with friends.
