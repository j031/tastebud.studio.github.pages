Love the alliteration in the name of this one. My family got this in our last purchase of pods. 

The smell is amazing. Dark chocolate and sweet peppermint, like a high-end fresh mint chocolate aroma. Mint continues in flavor but is blended with the coffees moderate roast chocolate like notes. Minty finish is refreshing, not as strong as peppermint candy but has light tingling.

Overall, I love this flavor combination and the balance with just the right amount of peppermint.
