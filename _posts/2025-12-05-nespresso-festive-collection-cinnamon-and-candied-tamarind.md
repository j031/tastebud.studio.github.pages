I love that every few weeks my family surprises me with a batch of specialty coffees from Nespresso. Lately, I’ve been enjoying the 2025 Festive Collection.

Initial impressions are warm holiday spice flavors. They include light cinnamon but not spicy, crisp fruity brown sugar and moderate roast.

Overall very impressed with the clean flavors. Love the design on the package.
