This is by far one of my favorite flavors. It's low acid with light chocolate and coffee roast. It has a slight creamy mouthfeel that is pleasant into the finish. It has just enough coffe to make it interesting but not overwhelm. It is also only moderately roasty and not sweet. Really good blend of flavors.
